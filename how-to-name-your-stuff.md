# How to name your *stuff*

Your files and folders should be **named sensibly**. 

That is, named with enough information and in a predictable way.     
  
### Bad file names

* `stuff.txt` too vague
* `what I think about this topic.docx` which topic? also better not to use spaces to separate words
* `11120926_10152832542182633_37200453_n.jpg` am I a robot?
* `Untitled.psd` are you [an artist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untitled)?

### Better file names
 
* `meeting-notes_01-05-2015.txt` tells us what to expect in that file, and includes the meeting's date
* `interview-techniques_V2.docx` includes the document version
* `homepage-logged-in.jpg` describes what the file represents
* `projectXX-mockups.psd` describes what the file contains

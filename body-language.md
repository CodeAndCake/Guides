What is he worst thing that happened to you when you tried to talk to a stranger?

Homework for this week: sing on the Tube :)

Vivi doesn't take herself too seriously, or us.


**Handshake** Alpha-male temptation to try to break the other person's hand.

The way you say things is more important than what you say.

Body language communicates what's going on **inside us**.

How are you being perceived?

* 7% words
* 38% verbal
* 55% non-verbal

Don't put your mobile phone on the table.

Character: pay attention, listen actively.

Don't lie, rather be confidently honest. Project confidence and honesty. Sometimes in interviews they ask you a question just to know how you answer, to see if you are bullshitting.

*Don't drink coffee* before an interview!

Shoulders back: makes you open, slows your breathing down.

> You will lose one person because of your personality but you will gain plenty.

Always accept a glass of water (not hot drink, because you will dribble it).

Power pose: pump yourself up. In whatever way works for you.

Go to a bunch of job interviews and networking events: practice, practice, practice! For example: [Silicon Milk Roundabout](https://www.siliconmilkroundabout.com)

Always trust your **gut feeling**.

If your interviewer is looking negative, interview them. Ask them questions about their team, or what the job is like. Most bosses like to talk about their team.

**Never cover your mouth**. It appears as though you're lying. Or that you're not confident.

There are some 15-20 standard questions:

* When did you work well with others?
* If you were a biscuit, what would it be?
* How do you deal with conflict? Answer with an example or anecdote.

### Tips for impressive first impressions

1. Research the company, be prepared. Ask people that work there.
* Know who you are meeting. 
* A little bit of cheese is fine `I read your article and I find it very interesting because XYZ`.
* Give a firm handshake.
* Mirror them = copy what they are doing.
* Active listening. 
* Posture. Head tilted with eyes looking up.
* Take time to reflect on answers
* Lean in to the other person
* Relax your shoulders
* Don't fidget
* Taking notes is ok, generally (ask for it if in doubt).

### Practice

* Watch other people (especially strangers).
* Visualise positive outcome.

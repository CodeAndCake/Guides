# How to submit your work

1. Make sure your files are **named sensibly** (see [this short naming guide](how-to-name-your-stuff.md)). 
* Create a new folder and name it like so: `COURSECODE-Name-Surname`, for example `WEB12345-Matteo-Menapace`
* Add all the files you want to hand in to that folder.
* Create a **zip archive** for that folder. It should keep the `COURSECODE-Name-Surname` naming convention, for example `WEB12345-Matteo-Menapace.zip`
* Upload the zip archive to Moodle.

If your zip archive is **bigger than 256MB**

1. Upload it to [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com), [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) or any other bulk-storage service of your choice.
* Grab the **public link** to share it 
* Paste the link into a new text file (a `.md`, `.txt` or `.rtf` file, don't assume we have *Pages* or *Words* or any other fancy software)
* Create a new folder (using the same `COURSECODE-Name-Surname` naming convention) and add the text file to it 
* Zip the folder
* Upload to Moodle 

We ask you to follow the `COURSECODE-Name-Surname` naming convention so that it's quicker to sort your submissions out and know who they belong to. Imagine you had to go through 18 anonymous folders: nightmare! 

We will consider folders named `Hand in`, `Project` or `Archive` (and similar anonymous ones) equivalent to no submission, ie: **fail**. Seriously.

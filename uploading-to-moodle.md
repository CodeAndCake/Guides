# How to submit your work

1. Create a new folder and name it like so: `COURSECODE-Name-Surname`, for example `WEB12345-Matteo-Menapace`
2. Add all the files you want to hand in to that folder.
	
	Make sure your files are **named sensibly**. That is, named with enough information and in a predictable way.     
  
  	Bad examples: 
  	* `stuff.txt` (too vague)
  	* `what I think about this topic.docx` (which topic? also better not to use spaces to delimit words)
  	* `11120926_10152832542182633_37200453_n.jpg` (am I a robot?)
  	* `Untitled.psd` (are you [an artist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untitled)?)
  	
  	Good examples: 
  	* `meeting-notes_01-05-2015.txt` (tells us what to expect in that file, and includes the meeting's date)
  	* `interview-techniques_V2.docx` (includes the document version)
  	* `homepage-logged-in.jpg` (describes what the file represents)
  	* `projectXX-mockups.psd` (describes what the file contains)
3. Create a **zip archive** for that folder. It should keep the `COURSECODE-Name-Surname` naming convention, for example `WEB12345-Matteo-Menapace.zip`
4. Upload the zip archive to Moodle.

If your zip archive is **bigger than 256MB**

1. Upload it to [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com), [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) or any other bulk-storage service of your choice.
2. Grab the **public link** to share it 
3. Paste the link into a new text file (a `.md`, `.txt` or `.rtf` file, don't assume we have *Pages* or *Words* or any other fancy software)
4. Create a new folder (using the same `COURSECODE-Name-Surname` naming convention) and add the text file to it 
5. Zip the folder
6. Upload to Moodle 

We ask you to follow the `COURSECODE-Name-Surname` naming convention so that it's quicker to sort your submissions out and know who they belong to. Imagine you had to go through 18 anonymous folders: nightmare! 

We will consider folders named `Hand in`, `Project` or `Archive` (and similar anonymous ones) equivalent to no submission, ie: **fail**. Seriously.

# How to submit your work

1. Create a new folder and **call it with your name + this course's code**, for example `Matteo-Menapace-WEB12345`
2. Add all the files you want to hand in to this folder
3. Create a **zip archive** for this folder. It should keep the `Your-Name-WEB12345` naming convention, for example `Matteo-Menapace-WEB12345.zip`
4. Upload the zip archive to Moodle.

If your zip archive is **bigger than 256MB**

1. Upload it to [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com), [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) or any other bulk-storage service of your choice.
2. Grab the **public link** to share it 
3. Paste the link into a new text file (a `.md`, `.txt` or `.rtf` file, don't assume we have *Pages* or *Words* or any other fancy software)
4. Create a new folder (using the same `Your-Name-WEB12345` naming convention) and add the text file to it 
5. Zip the folder
6. Upload to Moodle 

We ask you to follow the `Your-Name-WEB12345` naming convention so that it's quicker to sort your submissions out and know who they belong to. Imagine you had to go through 18 anonymous folders: nightmare! 

We will consider folders named `Hand in` or `Archive` (and similar anonymous ones) equivalent to no submission, ie: **fail**. Seriously.

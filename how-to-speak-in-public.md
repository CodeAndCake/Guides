# Public speaking

Based on a workshop by [Vivi Friedgut](https://twitter.com/blackbullion).

What are you afraid of when speaking in front of people?

> Great speakers don't follow rules.

The only rule is: **be yourself**. *Authenticity* overrides *form*.

### Fundamentals

1. Having something to say.
* **Be organised**. 
	* You cannot wing a presentation.
	* If tech could fail, it will fail.
* Know your audience.
	* What are they interested in?
	* What are you trying to get across?  
	
### Tips	

1. Don't try to be **perfect**. 
	* Be good.
	* We don't trust people who are perfect.
	* If you make a mistake, make fun of it and then **move on**.
2. **Perception**: what you think people are thinking is not what they are actually thinking. Also, they probably don't care about your anxieties.
3. **Discipline**: practice your presentation.
4. **Description**: use real life experiences, or metaphors.
5. **Inspiration**: quickest way to engage people.
6. **Anticipation**: leave people wanting more about you and your topic. 

### Presentation structures

People will follow you as long as they know there is an **end**.

#### Classic 

1. Start: tell them what you're going to tell them
2. Middle: tell them
3. Finish: tell them what you've told them

#### Metaphor

1. Metaphor (inspire)
2. Sub-point
3. Conclusion: tell them what you've told them

#### Story

1. Point: this is what I'm getting at
2. Story, eg `This is something that I did. Don't do it` 
3. Application

### More tips

* Language tools
	* Alliteration is very effective
	* Repetition: `I have a dream` was repeated several time by MLK during his famous speech
	* Rhyme makes your communication more memorable

* Write, rewrite and then rewrite some more. 
	> If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, youâ€™ve launched too late.

### Delivery

1. Memorise it. Risky if you lose your train of thoughts.
* **Don't read it**. 
	* If you're reading out your slides, one of you don't need to be there.
	* It's good to have notes though. But you need to be looking at your audience.
* Improvise it, very risky.
* **Casual**, can be the most effective. 

### Elevator pitch

Brief, persuasive communication you use to spark interest in you. It is designed to sell you (your personal brand).

> Who is your Richard Branson? If they stepped in the elevator with you, what would you say?

1. Who are you?
2. What do you do?
3. Why are you special? *What would your mum/dad say about you?*
4. What do you want.

Example: Hello, I am X and I am a student at Y. I am a big fan of your product/brand/etc. and I know you're probably getting a lot of these requests, but I would love to get an internship etc. at Y, because...

> What's in it for them?

I want to be the best X in the world and the best place to do that is Y. I believe there's no better place for me to learn.

> The smartest people in the world are also quite humble (they have nothing to prove).

> Everybody that you want to meet you don't know yet

### Homework

1. Try to speak to a stranger, every day.
* What stories and events in your life can contribute to your next presentation?

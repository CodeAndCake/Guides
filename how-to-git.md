# Git

It's not a mild insult.

### What is it then?

It's a **distributed version control system**. It allows teams to work on the same documents (often code) at the same time, and without stepping on each other's toes. 

You can learn more about Git with this [interactive tutorial](https://try.github.io/).

### Why do we need it?

Because when you realise it's time to back up your files, it may be too late.

### Can we not use DropBox instead? 

Yes, however Git is more powerful. It allows you to **collaborate**, by solving *conflicts* for you.

### How does it work?

Using Terminal (or any other command-line tool) is very cool, in a Matrix-like way. However it's easier to have a visual interface sometimes. Most of the times. For that, you can use [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

1. Sign up (or log in) to [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Download [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com), it's free!
3. If you're on a Mac, clean up the global `.gitignore` (add `.DS_Store` so that files that are generated by Mac OSX will not be pushed to the *mothership*)
4. You're ready to use Git to keep your projects tidy, backed-up and collaborative!

5. **Clone** it to your computer
6. Put your stuff inside the `students > {yourName}` folder ([follow these instructions](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14104/tree/master/students)) -->

## The Git workflow

### 1. Edit

First, you edit your files on your computer (aka *Working Copy*).

Any changes you make to the Working Copy will appear on Source Tree.

* New files will appear with a question mark (?) next to them.
* Changed files will appear with an ellipsis (...) next to them.

### 2. Commit

When youâ€™re ready to save a copy of the current state of the project, you *stage* changes and *commit* them to the project history.

Whenever you commit a bunch of changes to your files, you will need to add a **commit message**. It can be anything, however it helps if you write something meaningful and descriptive of the changes you've made.

> It's good practice to **make lots of small commits** rather than one massive push at the end of the day.

### 3. Push

After you're commited some changes, a number icon will pop up over the *Push button*. 

This means that your commits are ready to be uploaded to the mothership (aka *origin repository*).

The name of our remote is *origin* and the default local branch name is *master*. 

**Push = upload**

If there are no conflicts between your files and those on the mothership, **you're done!**

### Pull

**Pull = download**

If other people are working at the same project, before you can upload your changes to the mothership (aka *origin repository*), you may need to **pull** the latest version from the mothership into your working copy. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/guides/master/assets/git-pull.png)

If there's a number over the *Pull button* you should pull those *remote* changes into your *Working Copy* (and possibly sort out conflicts before you can push your changes).

<!-- ### Pull request

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a Git repository. Once a pull request is sent, other people can review your changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.

We'll [learn more about pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) later on in the unit. -->
